    ![mustang_tail_lights](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f006cf7-bdce-4f7a-9d91-dbd62ee52f24)

Designed and implemented a Mustang Tail Light Controller in Verilog, featuring sequential light patterns for turn signals and brake integration. Key features include:

Sequential Signaling: Implements {001} → {011} → {111} → {000} pattern for left/right turn signals.

Brake Integration: Ensures all lights illuminate when braking.

Dynamic Mode Switching: Seamlessly restarts sequences when changing modes.

Hardware Verification: Validated through testbench simulations, annotated waveforms, synthesis reports, and timing analysis.
